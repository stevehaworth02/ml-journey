# ML Journey Repository 🌱➡️🌲

## Introduction: My Learning Story

Welcome to my machine learning journey! This repository is more than just code—it's a living document of my growth as a Python developer and ML practitioner. Here, you'll find:

- **Progress Tracking**: From messy data wrangling to deploying production-ready models
- **Skill Evolution**: Concrete milestones in ML engineering, deep learning, and MLOps
- **Project Artifacts**: Real-world implementations with increasing complexity

I'm building this in public to:
1. Create accountability for continuous improvement
2. Develop a portfolio that "shows, not tells" 
3. Document hard-won lessons that tutorials don't cover

Join me as I stumble through errors, have "aha!" moments, and gradually level up!

## Roadmap & Phase Goals

### 🔁 Phase 1: Real-World ML Pipelines (Intermediate)
**Objective**: *"From Jupyter mess to robust pipelines"*

#### 🧱 Core Skills
- Handle missing data intelligently (not just `SimpleImputer`)
- Feature engineering that moves metrics (not just academic)
- Hyperparameter tuning that survives real-world data shifts

#### ✅ Milestones
- [ ] Master `ColumnTransformer` for mixed data types
- [ ] Build ensemble pipelines with `FeatureUnion`
- [ ] Achieve top 25% in a Kaggle competition using pure scikit-learn
- [ ] Implement custom metrics for imbalanced datasets

---

### 🚀 Phase 2: Model Deployment & MLOps
**Objective**: *"From local pickles to live endpoints"*

#### 🌐 Deployment Stack
- FastAPI for model serving
- Streamlit for rapid prototyping
- Dockerized environments
- CI/CD with GitHub Actions

#### ✅ Milestones
- [ ] Deploy image classifier with <100ms latency
- [ ] Create CI pipeline that runs tests on model updates
- [ ] Build loan approval demo app with adjustable risk thresholds
- [ ] (Stretch) Go inference service with gRPC

---

### 🧠 Phase 3: Deep Learning Dive
**Objective**: *"Understand what's inside the black box"*

#### 🤖 Focus Areas
- **PyTorch Fundamentals**: Manual backprop, custom layers
- **CV**: From MNIST to medical imaging
- **NLP**: BERT fine-tuning for domain-specific tasks
- **Time Series**: Weather prediction with attention

#### ✅ Milestones
- [ ] Implement ResNet-18 from scratch (no `torchvision`)
- [ ] Fine-tune BERT for reddit sentiment analysis
- [ ] Build LSTM that outperforms ARIMA on stock data
- [ ] Create Gradio demo for custom image segmentation

---

### 📦 Phase 4: Portfolio & Theory
**Objective**: *"From coder to ML engineer"*

#### 🧳 Portfolio Requirements
- 3 production-grade projects (end-to-end)
- Mathematical intuition for key algorithms
- Blog posts explaining non-obvious insights

#### ✅ Milestones
- [ ] Publish "How I Beat Baseline Without Feature Engineering" post
- [ ] Build ML-powered trading bot with risk analysis
- [ ] Implement SVD from scratch with NumPy
- [ ] Create video walkthrough of model serving architecture

---

### 🎓 Bonus: Competitive & Academic Edge
- **Kaggle**: Monthly competition entries
- **arXiv**: Weekly paper summaries
- **System Design**: Whiteboard-style ML architecture diagrams

## How to Navigate This Repo

1. **Phase-Based Learning**: 
   - Each phase has its own directory
   - Projects get progressively harder (`/phase1/beginner` → `/phase4/expert`)

2. **Progress Tracking**:
   - `LEARNINGS.md` in each folder documents key insights
   - `/blog` contains technical writeups

3. **Recreate Projects**:
   ```bash
   conda env create -f environment.yml
   python -m phaseX.projectY.train


## Join the Journey!

This isn't a polished course—it's a real skill-building grind. Expect:

*Messy first drafts → Refactored solutions*  
*"Why is this broken?!" commits → "Oh THAT'S why!" fixes*  
*Simple scripts → Modular OOP code*

**Star this repo** to track my progress, and feel free to open issues with suggestions!
